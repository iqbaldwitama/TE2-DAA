### HamiltonGenerator.java
Run this code to generate a graph inputs containing Hamiltonian Path with specified vertices. You can adjust the number of vertices by changing the V variable in the main method. The inputs will be saved in a txt file with `hamilton_` prefix.

### NonHamiltonGenerator.java
Like the previous file, you can run this code to generate a graph inputs without Hamiltonian Path with specified vertices. You can adjust the number of vertices by changing the V variable in the main method. The inputs will be saved in a txt file with `non_hamilton_` prefix.

### DP.java
Run this code to solve the problem using Dynamic Programming. Make sure to adjust the number of vertices and the graph type in the main method. You will get information about the running time and the memory space used by the program.

### Backtracking.java
Run this code to solve the problem using Backtracking. Make sure to adjust the number of vertices and the graph type in the main method. You will get information about the running time and the memory space used by the program.
